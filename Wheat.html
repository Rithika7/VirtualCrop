    <h2>Wheat Cultivation</h2>
    <p>Wheat farming or cultivation can be very easily done. Here is how you can start with it:</p>
    <input type="button" onclick="st1()" value="STEP-1">
    <div id="st1">
      <h2>1. Choose a good location </h2>
      <p>The very important part of wheat farming is selection of an appropriate place.  You must look for a place that has fertile soil for wheat farming. Soil with a loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are some factors that you must consider to grow wheat.
      About 1,000 square feet will yield one bushel, or 60 lbs (30 kg), of grain. That’s about the space of a backyard. You'll need to figure out how much wheat you want to grow and how much space it will take.
      </p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <input type="button" onclick="st2()" value="STEP-2">
    <div id="st2">
      <h2>2.Soil Preparation</h2>
      <p>The soil must be properly prepared before starting the wheat farming. For this you can plough the soil either with disc or mould board plough. Then arrange the soil by giving one deep plough, followed by 2 to 3 light ploughing and planking. Now add natural fertilizers to it. For commercial wheat farming, an average of 50 kg Nitrogen, 25 kg Phosphorus and 12 kg Potash is sufficient in one acre of land. Add more organic contents while preparing the soil.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <input type="button" onclick="st3()" value="STEP-3">
    <div id="st3">
      <h2>3.Determine the type of wheat you'll plant</h2>
      <p>Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested in early spring. It also tends to be the preferred variety since it is more nutritious and competes with fewer weeds in the spring. Spring wheat is planted in the spring and harvested in the fall. It is the more common variety in areas that have colder winters.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <input type="button" onclick="st4()" value="STEP-4">
    <div id="st4">
      <h2>4.Choose your planting location.</h2>
      <p>Your wheat should get plenty of sun while it grows, so make sure you plant it in full sun. The area where you plant should get about eight hours of sun a day. This is true whether you plant winter or spring wheat. Don't plan on planting your crop anywhere where there's too much shade.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <input type="button" onclick="st5()" value="STEP-5">
    <div id="st5">
      <h2>5.Time your planting season.</h2>
      <p>Prepare to plant winter wheat in the fall, approximately 6 to 8 weeks before the soil freezes, as this allows for strong root growth. Spring wheat can be planted as early as you can work the soil. Wheat grows best in 70 to 75 degree Fahrenheit ((21 to 24 degrees Celsius) weather, so you should plant your wheat when the weather is approaching that temperature (and eventually rising).</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <input type="button" onclick="st6()" value="STEP-6">
    <div id="st6">
      <h2>6.Pick a variety</h2>
      <p> 
        Wheat is available in many different types and varieties all over the world. Some popular wheat varieties available and cultivated in India are as follows:
        DBW 17,
        HD 2851,
        HD 2932,
        PBW 1 Zn,
        Unnat PBW 343,
        PDW 233,
        WHD 943,
        TL 2908, etc
        Make sure you choose the right variety of wheat according to the climatic conditions of your region. You can also consult an experienced farmer in your area to help you choose the right wheat variety.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <input type="button" onclick="st7()" value="STEP-7">
    <div id="st7">
      <h2>7.Seeding</h2>
      <p>Wheat seeds are easily available in the market. While purchasing the seeds, make sure it is of good quality, high yielding and disease free. Usually 40 to 50 kg seeds are required in one acre of land. Although exact amount of seeds required depends on the variety and sowing method.You should till your soil to a depth of 6 inches (15 cm). You can use a rake, rototiller, or shovel to prepare the soil, although a rototiller is probably best if you're covering a large area. The ground needs to be as close to even as possible once you're finished, so you might need to run a rake over the top of the soil to even it out</p>

    <input type="button" onclick="st8()" value="STEP-8">
    <div id="st8">
      <h2>8.Spread compost if necessary. </h2> 
      <p>If your soil is overly dry (it will be a light brown color) or somewhat rocky, you might need a layer of compost. This provides the soil with extra nutrients and can help the wheat grow better. Soil that is a rich brown color and moist to the touch doesn't need any extra compost.</p>    
    </div>
    <br>
    <input type="button" onclick="st9()" value="STEP-9">
    <div id="st9">
      <h2>9.Spread your seeds.</h2>
      <p> You can use your hand, but an actual seed spreader is best, because it gives you more even coverage. You should spread the seeds so that you have approximately one seed per 1 square inch (2.5 square centimeters) of space. The package of seeds should tell you how many pounds of seed you should use per 1,000 square feet of planting area, to give you a better idea of how much seed you need for large areas</p>

    <input type="button" onclick="st10()" value="STEP-10">
    <div id="st10">
      <h2>10.Rake the seeds</h2>
      <p>Once you’ve spread the seeds, they need to get worked into the soil. Using a metal rake, gently rake over the seeds so they get worked into the soil. Make sure you rake evenly so your crop doesn't come up in clumps.</p>

    <input type="button" onclick="st11()" value="STEP-11">
    <div id="st11">
      <h2>11.Cover the seed with a thin layer of soil</h2>
      <p>This prevents the seed from drying out in the sun and from birds feeding on it. Cover spring wheat without about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of soil. Winter wheat should be 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) deep. The seed should never be covered by more than 3 inches (7.6 cm) of soil.</p>

      <h2>12.Caring</h2>
      <h3>a.Watering</h3>
      <p>
      Good and proper irrigation is required for wheat farming. First irrigation must be done after 20 to 25 days after planting the seeds. Then, additional 4 to 5 irrigation should be done after every 20 days. You should soak the area that’s planted right away. Keep the entire planting area moist until the wheat begins to grow. Cooler weather and more rain means less watering on your part.</p>

      <h3>b.Weeding</h3>
      <p>Most of the weeds in your field can be controlled while preparing the soil. Hence make sure you remove the weeds properly. For additional weeding you can use wide  range of chemicals available in the market.Wheat grows very close together, so you might not need to weed regularly. You should, however, keep an eye out for weeds, especially if it's your first time growing and you haven't spread your seeds evenly.</p>
      <h3>c.Fertilization</h3>
      <p>You don’t need to add more fertilizers if you had previously added it while preparing the soil.</p>

      <h2> 13.Pest and disease control</h2>
      <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e9/Plant-Wheat-Step-13.jpg/aid1297244-v4-728px-Plant-Wheat-Step-13.jpg.webp" alt="How to grow Wheat?" width="400" height="300">
      <p>The wheat plants are susceptible to many pests and diseases like aphids and termites. While some of the common diseases in wheat plants are brown rust, powdery mildew, Flag smut, etc. To control the pests or diseases, you can use good quality pesticides or insecticides. You can also consult with the local agriculture extension office or an expert who can give you proper advice on it.Slugs and insects like sawflies can destroy a crop of wheat. Slugs are likely to appear when the wheat is still very short, under 4 or 5 inches (9 to 10 cm). If you see them, use slug baits to keep them away from your wheat. If you notice sawflies, spray your crop with insecticide to protect the wheat.</p>

    <div id="st14">
      <h2>14.Harvesting</h2>
      <p>Harvesting starts when the leaves and stem turn yellow in color and become fairly dry. Remember that the wheat must be harvested before it is dead ripe to avoid loss in yield. Thus, timely harvesting is necessary for good quality as well as maximum production of wheat. When the moisture content in the wheat reaches to about 25 - 30%, then the wheat is ready to be harvested. Combine harvester are available in the market for harvesting, threshing and winnowing of wheat crop in a single operation.</p>
